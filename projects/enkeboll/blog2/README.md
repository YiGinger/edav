## Blog 2

I wanted to show, a little clearer, the data I found at http://www.nwlc.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/nov2013_state_by_state_women_overall.pdf.  This first attempt is not much clearer, but was a good exercise in acquiring, cleaning, and joining data, and getting that data on a screen.  It currently only shows the same information as the original chart did, just with the exact numbers overlaid on top of the states themselves.

## Blog 3

Blog 3 is forthcoming, and will augment the work I did on blog 2 by adding tool tips, legend, and options to change the data based on standard of living averages (which have already been pulled in the data, and just need to be accessed).
