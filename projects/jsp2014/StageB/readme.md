## Contents for Stage B

* __Folder 'Python'__: this folder contains two scripts and the iPython notebook. The scripts are as follows:
	* extractdata extracts the VP$IP and PFR data from the databases
	* separateregs consolidates the data, and uses k-means and Gaussian Mixture Models to pull apart the recreational population from the regulars population.
*  Here is a dropbox link to Stage B's csv files, which will not fit on github: __[download me](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9o6r265quccnr5c/bbWJefvTcH)__
