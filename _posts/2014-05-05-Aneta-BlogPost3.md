## Automobile Insurance Data Trends

For my 3rd Blog Post, I choose to look at 18 years of Auto Insurance expenditures by states. The data source was from US census.gov that provided average expenditures per insured vehicle by 50 states. The average expenditure equals total premiums written divided by liability car-years, where a car-year is equal to 365 days of insured coverage for a single vehicle.
From the raw data, I tried to obtain insights from looking at the data in different dimensions. My approach was to look at certain simple facts and evaluate to see if there are possibilities for the Auto Insurance companies to raise their premiums, if so how effectively they can achieve those price increases.
###10 year trend in auto insurance expenditures

It is very clear that auto insurance premiums have steadily increased across most states in the US over the last 10 years. This trend indicates that insurance premiums will tend to be more in the next 10 years than be less relatively.

2.	Average increase in insurance premium of 37% across all 50 states over an 18 year period
Insert 2 graphs of less than and greater than 37% increase in premiums
There were many states with less than 37% increase in premiums and it was interesting to find that many were North Eastern states with higher and urban populations but had initial higher insurance premiums relative to other states. However, many rural and mid-western states had the most increases, some even 90% increases in auto premiums over the 18 year period, for ex. Wyoming had a 91% increase and Hawaii and CA having decreased premiums.

3.	Average insurance costs fluctuated quite regularly during the periods 2003 – 2008.

While there is no clear rationale, it was quite interesting to find that there was no significant fluctuations in annual insurance premiums during the period 1991 – 1996, the changes in premiums were quite marked during the period 2003 – 2008.

This information/insight might be quite valuable for insurance companies that the timing is ripe for premium increases based on historical trends. This opportunity is further solidified by the insurance premium increases which were very consistent over 3 year periods for the last 18 years. Additionally, potential for substantial increase is also quite possible where average premium increases in states have been less than the average 37% increase.

####Comparisons

3 sites were looked at to see how they had approached this issue of increasing insurance premiums. But none of them had the comparative view on 18 years of data across all states in the US. I felt we could improvise on this by looking at the raw data from census.gov to derive meaningful insights for insurance companies to raise premiums. I also used some charts from R and google Vizualization bubble charts to do visual analysis.

####Final Thoughts
It is quite likely to attain useful and viable insights from data by keeping the approach simple. For example, by manipulating the data and visualizing it by adding certain key triggers like averages, % increases, aggregating the data in 3 year chunks etc. provided valuable commercial insights and potentially profitable decisions can be made from these insights.
