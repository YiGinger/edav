description: Visualizing geocode data in R using ggmap package

The intent behind this blog post is to learn how to use R's ggmap package to visualize geocode data. There are many options available in R to visualize geocode data but my research indicates this package provideds detailed output with a few lines of code.
I am so satisified with the ease of using this package that we have also incorporated this in our final project analysis.

Here's a breakdown of what I did for this blog post:

1\. I used the geocode() function available in the ggmap package and passed it the city information from my dataset.

This is how you capture the longitude and latitude information for the cities and append it to the dataframe:
```{r chunkLabel}
library(ggmap)
freq <- as.data.frame(table(data$City))
longlat <- geocode(unique(as.character(data$City))) 
cities <- cbind(freq, longlat)
```

2\. The second step was to generate a map of all the U.S. state on which I can superimpose the data I have for all the cities that I want to show in the visualization.
```{r chunkLabel}
states <- map_data("state")
p <- ggplot(states, aes(x=long, y=lat, group = group)) 
p <- p + geom_polygon(fill="grey10", colour="white") 
```

3\. In my dataset I wanted to focus on the tri-state area and so I created a subset vecotr of all the cities in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut Area.
```{r chunkLabel}
tri_states <- subset(states, region %in% c( "connecticut", "new jersey", "new york")) 
p <- ggplot(tri_states, aes(x=long, y=lat, group = group)) 
```
4\. Finally I plot the points on the map by passing the dataframe with the longitude and latitude columns and size of the point as the frequency.

I also changed the x coordinates to focus on the tristate area in the map and added another layer for showing the city name on the map.
```{r chunkLabel}
p <- p + geom_point(data=top_cities, inherit.aes=F, aes(x=long, y=lat, size=Freq), colour="red", alpha=.8) + scale_size(name="Claim Frequency")
p <- p + xlim(-80, -70)
p <- p + geom_text(data=top_cities, inherit.aes=F, aes(x=long, y=lat, label=City), vjust=1, colour="red", alpha=.8)
```

5\. [Source code in R](https://github.com/msingh4674/edav/tree/gh-pages/assets/msingh4674-1/blog p3.R)  Complete source code of the R script.

Future Improvements

I plan to explore more the output = "more" in the geocode() function of the ggmap package. This gives more detailed information on the location in addition to 
the longitude and latitude coordinates.
