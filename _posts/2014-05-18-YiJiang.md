The Analysis of Dependencies of R packages
======================
#Introduction
We are going to explore some data about the dependency relations between differenct R packages. 
In R, packages are often built depending on other packages. But what are packages that are most referenced? Can we visualize the relationship between those R packages? In this post, I am going to explore those quesions in R.

#Data
We can directly read the data about the information of R packages through R console.
```
require(stringr)
data<- as.data.frame(available.packages(),stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
head(p)

pkgs <- data.frame(data[,c(1,4)])                  # Pick out Package names and Depends
pkgs$Depends2 <-strsplit(pkgs$Depends,",")      # split list of Depends
pp<-mat.or.vec(nrow(pkgs),length(d.pkg))
rownames(pp)<-pkgs$Package
colnames(pp)<-d.pkg
rownames(pkgs)<-pkgs$Package
#sparse.model.matrix(matrix(0,nrow(pkgs),nrow(pkgs)))
dep<-unlist(pkgs$Depends2)
dep<-str_extract(dep,"[[:alpha:]][[:alnum:]]+")
dep<-dep[is.na(dep)]
freq<-table(dep)
freq.d<-sort(freq,decreasing=TRUE)
```
Now we have got all the packages that have been depended by other packags and get the frequency of reference. Let's look at what's the most popular 20 packages.
```
freq.d[1:20]
```
  methods      MASS     stats   lattice     utils  graphics  survival    Matrix   mvtnorm   ggplot2      grid 
      583       367       353       184       183       166       160       158       153       111        96 
     Rcpp     tcltk        sp grDevices      coda  parallel       rgl      nlme   splines 
       89        84        75        74        73        73        68        67        63 

```

d.pkg<-names(freq.d)


for(i in 1:nrow(pkgs)){
  #for(i in 1:10){
  pkg.name<-pkgs$Package[i];print(pkg.name)
  BY<-unlist(pkgs[pkg.name,"Depends2"])
  BY<-str_extract(BY,"[[:alpha:]][[:alnum:]]+")
  BY<-BY[!is.na(BY)]
  if (length(BY)>0){
    print(BY)
  pp[pkg.name,BY]<-1
  }
}
setdiff(d.pkg,pkgs$Package)# be depended but not included in the Package 


```
