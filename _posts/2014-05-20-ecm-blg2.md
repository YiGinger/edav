# Analysis of Text Attributes for Kaggle Competition

Kaggle's newest competition focuses on predicting the sentiment of movie reviews on a 1-5 scale based on text analysis.  The full competition and data set can be found on the [Kaggle Website](http://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews).  As a rudimentary start, I wanted to look at a few overall distributions and see if the number of phrases held any bearing on the sentiment rating.  

I first looked at the overall frequency of ratings for each phrase within a review.  It is (surprisingly) evenly distributed from 0-4 with the majority of counts centered at 2.

If we aggregated up to rating of all phrases within a sentence id, we get similar results although there is a weird dip at 2...

The total frequency of phrase counts tends to center around 5-20.  It is definitely skewed left and could potentially be adjust to log-scale.

Looking at both frequency and mean, there is no apparent connection between length of review and the rating.

When we look at a smoothed line, we can see that the mean varies only slightly.  The more important point is the change in variance.  As a user writes more, they tend toward the extremes in their rating.  Intuitively, this makes sense. A long review is emotional -- the user either loved it or hated it!
