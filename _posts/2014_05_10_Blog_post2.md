# Introduction

## rCharts 
I tried the packages "rCharts" in R and try to use it to make some graphs. I really find it a very useful and convient tool to visualize data. We should first install packages: devtool, rCharts.

# Data
The data I use here is the information of universities in America about their admition and achievements.
• Private : Public/private indicator
• Apps : Number of applications received
• Accept : Number of applicants accepted
• Enroll : Number of new students enrolled
• Top10perc : New students from top 10% of high school class
• Top25perc : New students from top 25% of high school class
• F.Undergrad : Number of full-time undergraduates
• P.Undergrad : Number of part-time undergraduates
• Outstate : Out-of-state tuition
• Room.Board : Room and board costs
• Books : Estimated book costs
• Personal : Estimated personal spending
• PhD : Percent of faculty with Ph.D.’s
• Terminal : Percent of faculty with terminal degree
• S.F.Ratio : Student/faculty ratio
• perc.alumni : Percent of alumni who donate
• Expend : Instructional expenditure per student
• Grad.Rate : Graduation rate

# Explore Data
I think there are several questions we could try to find answers in this dataset. 
1. Whether the private school and public school have great difference in admission or other aspect and what are those differences?
2. Will the position of an university have some impacts in those 



Enroll: The number of enrollment of students
Apps: The number of application from students
Accpet : The number of application they accept

rt<-read.csv("College.csv",header=TRUE)
colnames(rt)<-gsub("[.]","",colnames(rt))
d1<-rPlot(Enroll ~ Apps | Private,data=rt,type='point',
          height= 900,
          width = 850,
          tooltip = '#! function(item) {return item.X} !#')

d1
d1$save("Post2-1.html",cdn=TRUE)
