## Social Network Analysis vs Feature-based Clustering


While social network analysis has gained popularity as an approach for deriving clusters, I was interested in comparing this method against more traditional clustering methods, such as k-means.

Using StockTwits - a financial microblogging site that mimics Twitter's short posts and ultra-connected community - I was able to overlay k-means clustering based on features from users' profile on top of users' social network.

Because the 5K user graph was too unwieldy, the users are limited to 500-800 users with over 5 edges - i.e. connections between users.  The graph can be viewed [here](http://www1.ccls.columbia.edu/~hatim/StockTwits/).

To analyze the two methods, we computed a Q statistic, which is defined as the in-cluster weights (or edges) between users in a cluster divided by the total weights (or edges) for users in a cluster.


The results

Only cluster 2 shows significant in-cluster connections.  Most other groups show a lot of out-of-network connections.
