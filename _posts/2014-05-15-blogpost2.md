[_"The History of the Football World Cup Finals"_](http://themissinggraph.wordpress.com/2010/05/12/the-history-of-the-football-world-cup-finals-1930-2006/) is a blog post that attempts to summarize all the past games of the FIFA World Cup in one graph. While it presents a simple and beautiful graph, I think that there is more that can be included in a one-graph minimalistic presentation of the history of FIFA World Cup.

I used the data I scraped from the FIFA website to prepare the information that I need to convey a wholistic view of the FIFA World Cup (more or less). I gathered information on every single match of the World Cup since 1930, the number of scores each team had, the location of the games, as well as the year of the game. Another piece of information that I added was the difference between the number of goals the two teams scored (team 1 minus team 2). Positive numbers indicate winners, negative numbers indiciate losers, and zeros indicate ties. I synthesized all the above information in one graph to present an overview of the history of the World Cup. Voila!

Each square in this box represents one match. The caption on each square has the countries of team 1, team 2, the location, and the year in which the game took place. The size of the square represents the difference of the number of goals scored by the two teams (the larger the square, the larger the discrepency). I used red for negative numbers and green for positive nubmers. The darker the shades, the larger the discrepncy between the scores. From this graph, the viewer can have a very straightforward overview of all the games since 1930. 

Well. Almost. Because of the size of this graph, we cannot possibly fit all the games. Unfortunately, the games that resulted in a tie are mostly ommitted (because of their small size). The games that resulted in the largest difference of scores are instead magnified. After realizing this limitation of the graph, I separated the data into three difference senarios: wins, losses, and ties. I repeated the same steps to generate  three different scenarios in three difference graphs. This way, I was able to include more matches and avoided descriminating against games that resulted in a tie.
