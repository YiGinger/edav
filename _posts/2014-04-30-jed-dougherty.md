Project Update:
I have successfully been tracking data from my sleeping patters and multiple check-ins per day
using Reporter and Sleep Cycle. I currently have three data sets.

My first data set contains:

* Start
* End
* Sleep.quality
* Time.in.bed
* Wake.up
* Sleep.Notes
* Hours.in.bed
* date

My second data set contains:

* "Timestamp.of.Report..GMT."                        
* "Latitude"                                         
* "Weather"                                          
* "Ambient.Audio..dB."                               
* "Number.of.Steps"                                  
* "What.did.you.learn.today."                        
* "How.did.you.sleep."                               
* "How.many.coffees.did.you.have.today."             
* "How.many.alcoholic.beverages.did.you.have.today." 
* "Drugs."                                           
* "Timestamp.of.Report..Local.Time."
* "Longitude"                       
* "Number.of.Photos.Added"          
* "Ambient.Audio.Description"       
* "Who.are.you.with."               
* "What.are.you.doing."             
* "Are.you.working."                
* "Where.are.you."                  
* "What.are.you.stressed.about."    
* "date"                            

My third data set contains a Json file that has the start and end times of each night of sleep
along with a tracking of each of my movements during that sleep. 

I have also scraped data off of the sleepCycle site, since they do not provide some data directly.
I have just started analyzing the data but here are a couple of graphs that imply stuff
that could be interesting:
