## Magic: The Gathering BNG Standard Format Analysis

Chances are that if you don't know about or play Magic: the Gathering (MtG) then you know someone that does.  It is a trading card game that has been in existence for over 20 years now, and in recent years its player-base has been growing exponentially.

Without going too far in depth, here is the premise:
* There are many many cards available, they all do unique things
* Every 3 months, Wizards of the Coast releases a new set of a few hundred cards each.
* People make decks from these cards and "do battle" with each other at the tournament level to win a wide range of prizes.  Some even go home with thousands of dollars!
* "Standard" is a format where the fewest cards are available, which means that when a new set is released Standard is effected the most.
* But in the end, people play Magic because it is fun!

Welcome to nerd-sports!

# The Goal

In a sentence: "To create a time-lapse visualization of the evolution of the Standard format after the release of the 'Born of the Gods' set"

What this means is I want to look at the game-changing cards and deck archetypes that make the format tick.

# Scraping

First, I need to scrape websites for deck information of top decks that is hosted online.  Specifically I am narrowing my scope to only decks that finish in the "top 8" of tournaments with 64 people or more.

Here, I scrape the website [tcgplayer.com](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/?partner=WWWTCG):

```{python}
# local edited html file
ADDRESS = "tcgplayerDecksTOP8.html"

# Beautiful Soup initialization
soup = BeautifulSoup(open(ADDRESS))

# grab all of the hrefs in a tags
for link in soup.find_all('a', href=True):
    temp.append((link['href']))

# grab links to the decks (every third link) (1st, 4th, etc)
for i in range(len(temp)):
    if (i % 3 == 0):
        urls.append("http://magic.tcgplayer.com" + temp[i])

# grab dates of the decks
for date in soup.find_all('td', attrs={'width':'9%'}):
    dates.append(date.text)

# convert dates from unicode to string and then to date format
for i in range(len(dates)):
    dates[i] = datetime.date(datetime.strptime(unicodedata.normalize('NFKD',dates[i]).encode('ascii','ignore'),'%m/%d/%Y'))

# truncate each url to last 6 characters to obtain deck ID
for i in range(len(urls)):
    deckIDs.append(urls[i][-7:])

# deck registration sheet urls
for i in range(len(urls)):
    deckRegUrls.append("http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/printable_deck_reg_sheet.asp?ID=" + deckIDs[i])

# Gather card data
for i in range(len(urls)):
    page = requests.get(deckRegUrls[i])
    soup = BeautifulSoup(page.text)
    for card in soup.find_all('td', attrs={'class':'default_8'}):
        cardsTemp1.append(card.text)
    for deckName in soup.find_all('td', attrs={'class':'default_9'}):
        deckNames.append(deckName.text)
    # convert cards and deck names from unicode to string
    for i in range(len(cardsTemp1)):
        cardsTemp1[i] = unicodedata.normalize('NFKD',cardsTemp1[i]).encode('ascii','ignore')
    # munging
    cardsTemp1 = cardsTemp1[8:]
    for card in reversed(cardsTemp1):
        if card[-1:] == '\n' or card == '' or card == '?' or 'Island' in card or 'Swamp' in card or 'Mountain' in card or 'Forest' in card or 'Plains' in card:
            cardsTemp1.remove(card)
    for i in range(len(cardsTemp1)):
        cardsTemp2.append([int(cardsTemp1[i][:2]), cardsTemp1[i][2:]])
    cards.append(cardsTemp2)
    cardsTemp1 = []
    cardsTemp2 = []
```

# Munging

Now I have the data and need to put it into some form that I can use:

```{python}
numDecks = len(deckNames)

# more munging
for i in range(numDecks):
    deckNames[i] = unicodedata.normalize('NFKD',deckNames[i]).encode('ascii','ignore')

# Visualizing

Some simple preliminary python viz for exploration purposes:

![evolution of Standard](http://s27.postimg.org/5pihrwnv7/figure_1_evolution.png)

![25 best cards](http://s30.postimg.org/601g43k1t/figure_2_most_Relevant_Cards.png)

Clearly these are not finalized visualizations, I only made them for exploratory reasons.

# What's left?

I have been having some card image issues:
* parse to remove " //" from some card names (for example: "Turn // Burn" to "Turn Burn")
* find and remove the elusive phantom "?" cards
* The apostrophe problem: I am open to suggestions
* For some reason the top 25 cards do not show up on the list.

I will scrape more pages to get a more accurate depiction of the metagame (though I then run into another headache: removing duplicates).

I would like add a visualization based on card color(i think a pie chart would be good for this), in addition to color-coding the bars in the top-25 to reflect those colors.

If I have time, there should be another column on the card table for Price.  This will require building another scraper, but after looking into it, that implementation seems less hairy than the first.

In general I would like the code to be a bit more dynamic for ease of use, even though the data at this point is static.

All in all, there is quite a lot left to with this project, but I believe that the hardest parts have already been finished.

# What have I learned?

Most of all, I have learned to not waste too much time on the hairy implementations, and if I am banging my head against a piece of code for more than an hour with no progress then there is probably a better solution than the one I am attempting.
